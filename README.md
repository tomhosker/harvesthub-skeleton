# HarvestHub

The code is this repository describes a server for a website, the purpose of which is to hold the data generated by B-hive's HarvestEye systems in such a way that growers are able to access useful information.

## Installation

### Running the Website Using localhost

1. Clone the repository to your computer using the usual `git clone` method.
1. Install the node modules using `npm install`. (It may be helpful and/or necessary to put place a `sudo` before the aforesaid command.)
1. Run `npm start` and follow the link in the terminal. (If you're very crafty, you might want to try `sudo npm run devstart` instead.)

Please note that, unless you reconstruct the database locally, you won't be able to access pages which use the database over localhost.

### Deploying the Server to the Cloud

At the time of writing, we're using Heroku to host our website. See <https://harvesthub.herokuapp.com/>. Heroku itself is awash with instructions on how to deploy and update apps.
